 * This program is created to work with arrays. Using it, it is possible:
 * find the extreme values ​​(minimum and maximum elements), 
 * find the arithmetic mean and geometric mean values ​​of all elements, 
 * check whether all elements of the vector are in an ordered form, 
 * find the position of the first encountered local minimum (maximum), 
 * to find the position of the element of the array in two ways (linear or binary),
 * reverse all elements of the vector, 
 * sort the array in several ways.
